      <p class="hero-description">
        I'm Robert Otieno, a software engineering student at the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton. I'm passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems, especially in sectors that need innovation like construction, education, and ministry. I value clean, functional design and well-structured backend logic.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-description">
        I consider myself disciplined, highly curious, and always open to learning from both peers and professionals. I've dedicated time to strengthening my coding, improving my UI/UX skills, and exploring how technologies can bring people and processes together. I believe in impact-driven development, and I always strive to build with purpose.

        <h3>My Journey at Xiracom Limited</h3>
        <p>
          My journey at Xiracom Limited was a defining period in my development as a software engineer. It wasn't just an internship — it was a full immersion into the pace and professionalism of a working tech team.
        </p> 
        <p>
          During my time at Xiracom, I was involved in the design and prototyping of a Church Management System (CMS), which aimed to streamline communication, event scheduling, and member engagement within church communities. Using Figma, I created clean, user-friendly UI designs tailored for both church leaders and members.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collaborated closely with the development team to turn mockups into functional interfaces, ensuring alignment between user needs and system capabilities. I participated in feedback sessions and learned how to iterate design flows based on real stakeholder input.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work not only sharpened my design thinking but also gave me real-world insight into how early planning through wireframes and user flows can improve development efficiency and final product quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the technical, my time at Xiracom helped me grow professionally — I became more confident in meetings, learned how to deliver design presentations, and strengthened my communication skills with supervisors and peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked out of the experience with a deeper appreciation for teamwork, design systems, and the kind of thoughtful planning that drives successful software projects.

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>
          My core skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for frontend development. I've built multiple responsive interfaces and understand how to build clean, scalable component structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the backend, I'm proficient with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I've worked with Supabase for authentication and file storage, and I've integrated third-party services like Cloudinary for image management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use GitHub for version control, Postman for API testing, and deployment platforms like Render, Netlify, and Vercel. I'm comfortable working with RESTful APIs and enjoy building systems that are both secure and performant.
